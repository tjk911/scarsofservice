Scars of Service
==============

The SCTimes "Scars of Service" project was a year-long project that followed the lives of veterans around the area. Project will be expanded upon in the near future as the Times continues covering stories and challenges faced by veterans.

Reporting was done by Kirsti Marohn and Dave Unze, visual elements by Lisa Mueller, online elements by Andrew Fraser and Jun-Kai Teoh, photography by Kimm Anderson, videography by David Brakke digital leadership by Mike Knaak and project leadership by Lisa Schwarz.

Project code
==============

Project is primarily running on Foundation. Parallax was done with Skrollr.js, dynamic loading was achieved with a slightly tweaked dynamicpage.js. Grid code came from Codrops.

Chart was generated with Highcharts, while the map of the building boom is a simple slider using Gannett/USAT's Notchbuilder tool.

To-do
==============

* Cleanup and optimize code - heavy load on the page, CSS could do with additional cleaning
* Templating pages more
* Tweaking styling - a great deal of Foundation's basic stylings still remain
* Adapting project over to rdpapp

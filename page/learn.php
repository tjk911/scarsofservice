		    		<p style="text-align:left;">A traumatic brain injury is a blow or jolt to the head that disrupts the normal function of the brain and can have long-term cognitive effects. Because of advances in medical care, more service members are surviving their injuries but returning from combat with TBIs.</p>

		    		<p style="text-align:left;">The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs estimates up to 20 percent of veterans who served in Iraq or Afghanistan have post-traumatic stress disorder. Because not all veterans seek treatment, the numbers could be higher.</p>

		    		<p style="text-align:left;">A St. Cloud Times analysis of state death records found that 686 veterans died by suicide in Minnesota from 2007 to 2012. Almost 19 percent of suicides in Minnesota during those years were veterans, which closely tracks the national numbers.</p>

		    		<p style="text-align:left;">When Daniel Klutenkamper joined the Army in 2003, he knew there was a good chance he’d be sent to a war zone. He was OK with that. By October, the Missouri native who grew up in Lakeville was on his first overseas deployment to South Korea. In 2004, he was sent to Iraq.</p>

					<p style="text-align:left;">The military teaches that rank, speed, power and obedience to your superior officer in a vertical power structure means success and brings promotion. Having power over family members — or being subservient to them — won’t work in the family dynamic.</p>
